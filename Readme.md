Diamond Pricer! was created using Shiny, a web application framework for R developed and suported by RStudio.

This app leverages the 'diamonds' dataset delivered as part of the ggplot2 R package. Using this dataset we have developed a diamond price predictor given 4 input criteria (Carats, Cut, Color and Clarity) of a diamond.
